The award was presented to Ernie Gemperle's family at the annual holiday gathering. Gemperle, who passed away in 2008, was a longtime board president of the Foundation and was instrumental in the construction of the first on-campus residences, spearheading fundraising and construction to replace the single building that had housed students for years across Geer Road. His contributions extended beyond campus, founding the Ernie Gemperle Scholarship in his honor with friend Bob Triebsch and donating over \\\\$500,000, as well as establishing the Gemperle Family Farms College Scholarship Fund with the Stanislaus Community Foundation to aid children and grandchildren of Gemperle Farms employees. His children donated \\\\$250,000 in his honor and continue his legacy of giving back, with his son Steve Gemperle following his path both as president of Gemperle Enterprises and as Foundation Board President. Gemperle left a significant mark on the University and community, exemplified by the creation of the Ernie T.
